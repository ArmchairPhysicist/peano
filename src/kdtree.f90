module kdtree
  !! Provides routines for a k-dimensional tree, a space-partitioning data structure used for organizing points in k-dimensional space. Note that nearest neightbor searches within k-d trees are not suitable for high dimensional space and will likely perform no better than an exhaustive search. As a general rule of thumb, \(N \gg 2^k\).
